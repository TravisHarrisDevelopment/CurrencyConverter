This project is designed for a student who has learned about functions, 
specifications, and testing but has not yet learned any advanced control 
structures (if-statements, for-loops, etc.). It is also designed to be used in 
tandem with the introcs module, which simplifies a lot of advanced Python 
concepts.

To maintain the spirit of the assignment (and help with the grading process), 
certain Python commands are restricted in this assignment:
. No advanced control structures (conditionals, loops, try-except blocks)
. No Python or 3rd party modules other than introcs and the ones you make
. No method calls, including string methods
. Strings should use the functions in introcs instead of methods.

In addition, this project has the following style requirements:
. Every function must have a complete specification.
. Every module must start with a docstring with your name and date.
. There must be two blank lines between any two function definitions.
. Function bodies should be indented with 4 spaces.
. No non-docstring line may be longer than 80 characters.
. Lines inside of a docstring may be longer than 80 characters.
